release 0.2.0.0:
	better zoom handing:

	 * auto fit (double-click some element) will keep whole object in
	   viewport.

	 * click over links will not go immediately, so it's possible to
	   click and zoom over links as well

	 * both auto-fit and interactive zoom modes will not choose or
	   allow levels of zoom that makes contents smaller than viewport.


release 0.1.0.0:
