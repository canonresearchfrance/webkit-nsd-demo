UI
--
 * bookmarks: fixed "<Back" label intead of "<$PREVIOUS_NAME"?
 * better error reporting page (for 404 and similar)
 * show visual zoom indication (zoom level? some icon?)
 * show page icon (listen to signal, create object, feed theme, remember to del it when done)
 * change icon of Bookmarks (or name) to reflect History is there as well
 * move reload to URL bar?
 * url bar: clear button?
 * bookmarks: save page icon once it is known?
 * history: save icon
 * history: disable ewk built-in history and just use the one from eve, that should be saved with its state and restored on next startup.
 * ewk_view_bg_color_set() based on theme color class?
 * more: add search

Preferences / State
-------------------
 * preferences (runtime, save at eet):
   - toggle: use start page (otherwise home page)
   - string: proxy
 * privacy (maybe under preferences, maybe add management of each):
   - clear database
 * start page (like chromium, but mobile):
   - click to home URL (with icon and title -- if known)
   - easy access to bookmarks (click and expand the list? root entries?)
   - most visited/recent links?
   - recently closed?

View
----
 * fix zoom out (seems < 1.0 is not allowed) when page specifies a fixed viewport/contents size, check google.com with '-U iphone'
 * implement viewport tag support (good for mobile pages)

Misc
----
 * documentation: HTML, provided as a fixed bookmark item
 * download manager?
 * history + bookmark: remember if rss exist, and request it silently to display feedback when new content is available
